# DichroIDP
DichroIDPs is a user-friendly, free-to-download-and-use software program that enables the analyses of circular dichroism (CD) and synchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) spectroscopic data


## Instructions
* Download the DichroIDP repository and save the files onto your hard drive.
* Open the DichroIDP folder, which contains three folders: datasets, doc and DichroIDP. Do not remove any of these folders. Keep the whole package as it is.
* Open the DichroIDP folder and click on the .exe file (also make a shortcut to this file and put it on your desktop).
* In the first instance you will see a message with instructions on how to load the available datasets into the application. (The datasets are in the dataset folder).
    * Click the plus sign to the right of the dataset list box on the App interface.
    * Choose ‘browse’ from the dialog box.
    * Navigate to the dataset folder and open it
    * Inside this are folders named after the various datasets
    * Select a dataset folder (but do not open it)
    * Click ok on both dialog boxes twice and the dataset should appear in the list box.
    * Repeat for the other required datasets.
* This only needs to be done once. The application will remember where the datasets are and automatically load them whenever it is started, unless you move the package to another location on your hard disk or to another computer.
* If you move the package to another directory, remove each of the data sets from the dataset list box by clicking the minus sign to the right of it, then upload the datasets again.
* There is a full set of instructions in DA_help.http accessed via the help menu. If it does not open directly from the help menu, the file can be found in the doc folder.
* If you wish to create your own dataset open a dataset files which contain four text files: lbl1.txt, lbl2.txt, A.txt and F.txt. copy the files to another folder named after your new dataset, then replace the data in them with your own data.
    * A.txt contains CD data in columns from a high wavelength of 240nm
    * F.txt contains secondary structure data for each protein in a.txt in the same order using structural assignments found in lbl1.txt
    * lbl.2txt contains 1 row of protein labels in the same order.
    * Now load the dataset into the application as described in the help file.
